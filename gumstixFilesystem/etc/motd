Welcome to Gumstix!
By default, this gumstix is configured for CF support.
Unfortunately, this means MMC support has been
disabled out of the box.  To turn on MMC and turn off CF,
edit the file /etc/modules and comment out or delete the pcmcia (CF)
line, and uncomment the MMC lines.  You then also need to comment out
or remove the line "auto mwlan0" in /etc/network/interfaces if it
exists, since it will otherwise cause the pcmcia driver to be loaded.
